# Jagged VERSION 0.10.15
**Jagged** is a scripting language that aims to be intuitive and fun for small and large projects.

# Special Behaviors
**Jagged** has many quirks that make it unique to script in.  Here is a list of just a few:

 - *back-parsing* - This lets you parse your code backwards using the ***^*** keyword.

 - *String Write Variables* - To call variables to write to, you reference them as a string literal. This means you can also write to variables specified by the return value of functions.
